## Overview

`flutter_web_notification_platform` is a Flutter plugin designed to provide cross-platform support for web notifications. This plugin utilizes conditional imports to ensure that only the relevant code is executed depending on the platform (web or non-web). 

### Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Handles notifications for both web and non-web platforms, providing a seamless experience across different environments. 
- **Conditional Imports**: Utilizes Dart's conditional imports to load platform-specific implementations dynamically.
- **Customizable Notifications**: Allows sending and requesting permissions for notifications with customizable titles and messages.
- **Fallback Implementation**: Provides a default stub implementation for non-web platforms to handle cases where web notifications are not supported.
